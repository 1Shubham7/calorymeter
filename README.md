## README is WIP

Calorymeter is a full stack application built using **Go + React**. It allows users to track their daily calorie intake and provides personalized diet recommendations based on their dietary habits using **Gemini**. Key features include **email OTP validation** for secure account verification and **JWT authentication** for scalable session management. Build automation is managed using a Makefile to streamline development and deployment.

⭐ Star us on GitHub — it motivates me a lot!
